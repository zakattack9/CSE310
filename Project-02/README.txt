Project 2
Language: C++

The goal of this project was to implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. A graph is read in from a text file to create an edge adjacency list of the graph. The program should be able to compute both the length and path from a source to destination vertex. This implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm should also use a min-heap of the vertices of the graph, where the key value at a node is the currently known distance from the source to the given node.
