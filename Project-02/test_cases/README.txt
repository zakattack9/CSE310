These are the 30 posted test cases for project 2. Each is worth 1 point,
for a total of 30 points. There is no partial credit for the test cases.
Each test case is all or nothing. For each test_i.txt, where i = 1, 2, ...
30, there is a corresponding o_test_i.txt. So test_5.txt contains the 
console keyboard commands for posted test case 5, and o_test_5.txt contains
the expected output for the commands in test_5.txt. Your output must match
the output of all of the o_test_i.txt's EXACTLY.

All 30 posted test cases deal with the provided Ginput.txt. The provided
graph has 25 vertices and 50 weighted + directed edges. To make visualizing
the graph easier, we have provided a graph.png image that shows you the 
actual graph in Ginput.txt.

To make testing easier, we have provided a bash script run_tests. To run
this script, first enter "chmod u+x run_tests" and then run run_tests with
the command "./run_tests".

Testing will be automated. There are 200+ people in this class. The TAs do
not have the time to individually comb through each person's code and
spoonfeed points on a case-by-case basis. It will make your life significantly
easier if you test your code using the bash script rather than manually via
the console.

Good luck.
